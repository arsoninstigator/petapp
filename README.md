# pet adoption app
a pet adoption app that allows users to select available animals (from rescue shelters) and offer them a new home and proper care. there should be a chat feature so users can reach out to the shelter after viewing basic yet vital information about the animal (size, breed, dietary restrictions, favourite activities) on the app and deciding that they want to rescue them.

# build and run app

To see how your app looks and behaves on a device, you need to build and run it. Android Studio sets up new projects so that you can deploy your app to a virtual or a physical device with just a few clicks.
- In the toolbar, select your app from the run configurations menu.
- In the target device menu, select the device that you want to run your app on.
- If you don't have any devices configured, you need to either create an Android Virtual Device to use the Android Emulator or connect a physical device.
- Click Run

ps. a lot of the work done on this **after** arcade was done to get the ui running and making it shippable. i asked a friend for help. will scrape away all those parts as im collaborating with someone new to work on this project and create an actual tinder-like algorithm to allow users to swipe right on animals they think they'd be a good fit for and swipe left for those they won't.
